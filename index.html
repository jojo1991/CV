          I'm Jose Alvarado, full name: Jose L. Alvarado Jr. my family and close
          friends call me Jojo. I was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina to
          Norma and Joe Alvarado. Moved to San Antonio, Texas at around the age
          of five. Have lived there all my life since. Graduated from East
          Central High School while also attending UTSA in the summers and
          during the regular school years. I played football all four years of
          high school,some would say I should have gone pro, just kidding lol.
          After high School I left for the military and have since served 12
          years and still serving. I am currently deployed in Africa, more
          specifically I am in Mogadishu working on these courses. A little more
          about me: I was once married and now divorced, I have a six year old
          son waiting for me to come home in about two months and a loving
          family that is also waiting for me.
